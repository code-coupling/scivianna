You are working with a Data2D object that contains a set of cells with their associated colors and values.

The colors are set by a numpy array of RGBA values going from 0 to 255. You can play with the transparency value to highlight or dim areas. The highest the value, the more we want to see it. unless requested, try not to decrease the alpha value below 30.
